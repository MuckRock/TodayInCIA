# TodayInCIA
A bot that tweets out files from the CIA's CREST archive originally created on this day in history.

Data is pulled from the CIA's CREST Archive, [released after our lawsuit](https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2017/jan/19/three-year-saga-behind-CIA-release/) with [metadata cleaned up and released thanks to the efforts of MuckRock contributor Emma Best and Data.World](https://data.world/cia-crest-files/cia-crest-archive-metadata).

The bot itself builds on the work of Ben Nuttall's [Raspberry Pi OTD Twitter Bot](https://github.com/bennuttall/rpi-otd-bot), which he graciously allowed us to reuse under an open source license.
