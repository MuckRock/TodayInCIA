# TodayInCIA
A bot that tweets out files from the CIA's CREST archive originally created on this day in history. Built heavily off [Digital Ocean's great tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-twitterbot-with-python-3-and-the-tweepy-library).

Data is pulled from the CIA's CREST Archive, [released after our lawsuit](https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2017/jan/19/three-year-saga-behind-CIA-release/) with [metadata cleaned up and released thanks to the efforts of MuckRock contributor Emma Best and Data.World](https://data.world/cia-crest-files/cia-crest-archive-metadata).
